////////////////////////////////////////

- where to find examples from class

- how to clone lecture notes repo

- weekly review quizzes

- what to do before each class

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- logic puzzles
- begin logic gates and truth tables

/////////////////////////////////

The puzzles in this lecture are all either from or inspired by:
”What is the Name of This Book?”, by Raymond Smullyan

/////////////////////////////////
The first puzzles involve the island of Knights and Knaves.
Each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave.

Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and knaves ALWAYS lie.

/////////////////////////////////

Who can say, "I'm a knave"?

Can a knight?
Can a knave?






/////////////////////////////////

You see two inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

What are Ava and Bob?






/////////////////////////////////

You see two different inhabitants, Eve and Fred.

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

What are Eve and Fred?

(what does the "or" mean?)




////////////////////////////////////

You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, “Bill would tell you that I am a knave.”

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?

How could we rewrite/simplify each statement?

Sarah:
Bill:
Mae:



////////////////////////////////////

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days.”
Unicorn says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days, too.”

What day is it?








////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

You don’t know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: ”I’m Tweedledum.”
The second one says: ”I’m Tweedledee.”

Which is which? What day is it?







//////////////////////////////////
Another Tweedledee and Tweedledum (same rules).

First twin: Today is Monday or Wednesday
Second twin: Today is Monday or Sunday

What day of the week is it?

(what kind of OR?)



//////////////////////////////////
You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don’t know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.


The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle.”

The second one says: ”I'm Tweedledee!”

Who gets the rattle?




///////////////////////////////////////////
Based on Shakespeare's ”Merchant of Venice”.

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
One of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: ”The portrait is in this casket.”
Silver casket: ”The portrait is not in this casket.”
Lead casket: ”The portrait is not in the gold casket.”

Where is the portrait?

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."



Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."



Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."





When is Cheryl's birthday? .



///////////////////////////////////

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

∧ - and (can use a caret ^ )
∨ - or (inclusive or) (can use a capital V)
¬ - not (can use ! or ~ instead)
→ - implies (can use ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)

gates still used to design circuits

why do we care about equivalent circuits
    (especially if one uses fewer gates)?

what about programming?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q | p ∧ q
------------
T T |
T F |
F T |
F F |


OR:

p q | p ∨ q
------------
T T |
T F |
F T |
F F |


NOT:

p | ¬p
-------
T |
F |

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q | p → q
------------
T T |
T F |
F T |
F F |

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)

¬(p ∧ (q ∨ r))

p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)

/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?
