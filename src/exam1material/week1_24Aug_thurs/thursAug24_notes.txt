    "...thief was either Deer, Bunny, or Fox..."

EXCLUSIVE OR - just one animal is the thief

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- logic puzzles
- begin logic gates and truth tables

/////////////////////////////////

The puzzles in this lecture are all either from or inspired by:
”What is the Name of This Book?”, by Raymond Smullyan

/////////////////////////////////
The first puzzles involve the island of Knights and Knaves.
Each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave.

Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and knaves ALWAYS lie.

/////////////////////////////////

Who can say, "I'm a knave"?

Can a knight?
Can a knave?

Nobody!




/////////////////////////////////

You see two inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

What are Ava and Bob?

Suppose Ava is a knight. Then Bob has to be a knave.
    Then Bob's statement is a lie (as it should be)
    because it is false that neither one is a knave.

Suppose instead that Ava is a knave. Then Bob has to be a knight.
      Then Bob's statement would not be true (since Ava is a knave)
      but Bob should be telling the truth. Doesn't work.

Ava: knight
Bob: knave


/////////////////////////////////

You see two different inhabitants, Eve and Fred.

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

What are Eve and Fred?

(what does the "or" mean? INCLUSIVE)

Suppose Eve is a knight. Then her statement can only be true
    if Fred is a knight. At that point her OR statement is true,
    as it should be for a knight.

Suppose instead that Eve is a knave. It doesn't matter what
    Fred is -- Eve's statement would be true in this case.
    That shouldn't happen for a knave, so doesn't work.

Both knights.

////////////////////////////////////

You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, “Bill would tell you that I am a knave.”

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?

How could we rewrite/simplify each statement?

Sarah: Bill is a knight
Bill: Mae is a knight
Mae: Bill would tell you that I am a knave

Suppose Sarah is a knight. Then Bill has to be a knight,
    which means Mae has to be a knight. Mae's statement doesn't
    work -- Bill would say she is a knight, and Mae would tell
    the truth about that.

Suppose Sarah is a knave. Then Bill has to be a knave,
    which means Mae is also a knave. Mae's statement works --
    Bill would say she is a knight, but Mae would lie about
    what Bill would say.

Solution: all knaves

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days.”
Unicorn says: ”Yesterday was one of my lying days, too.”

What day is it?

Monday: Lion's statement works -- he should lie, and
    yesterday was NOT a lying day.

    Unicorn: should be telling the truth, but that would be a lie.

Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday: yesterday WAS a lying day
    for the current liar, so their statement won't work

Thursday: works out. Yesterday was one of Lion's lying days
    and he is telling the truth. Yesterday was not one of Unicorn's
    lying days and unicorn is lying.

Sunday:  Lion's statement doesn't work. He should be telling the truth
    and Saturday was NOT a lying day.


The day is: Thursday.






////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

You don’t know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: ”I’m Tweedledum.”
The second one says: ”I’m Tweedledee.”

Which is which? What day is it?

On every day but Sunday, one lies and one tells the truth.
On those days they would give the SAME name.

Must be Sunday. They are who they say they are.





//////////////////////////////////
Another Tweedledee and Tweedledum (same rules).

First twin: Today is Monday or Wednesday
Second twin: Today is Monday or Sunday

What day of the week is it?

(what kind of OR?) inclusive

Suppose first twin is telling the truth.
    Then it could be Monday or it could be Wednesday.

    Consider the other twin's statement. They must be lying
    (it can't be Sunday because the first twin's statement
    is supposed to be true and that wasn't one of the days
    they listed). Can't be Monday - that would make the
    second twin's statement true. Could be Wednesday.

Suppose second twin is telling the truth. Must be Monday
    or Sunday. Can't be Monday - would make first statement true
    and other twin should be lying. Also can't be Sunday -
    first twin should be telling truth and their statement would
    be false.

Must be Wednesday.

//////////////////////////////////
You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don’t know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.

(one is lying, one is telling the truth)

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle.”

The second one says: ”I'm Tweedledee!”

Who gets the rattle?

Suppose first twin is the truth teller. Then the second twin
    is the liar. Then Tweedledee must own the rattle. From
    the second one's statement, we know the first twin is Tweedledee
    and the second twin is Tweedledum.

Suppose second twin is the truth teller. Then the first twin
    is the liar. Evaluating, we have that Tweedledum owns the rattle.
    We also have that the second twin is Tweedledee and
    the first twin is Tweedledum.

In both cases, the first twin owns the rattle. We give it to them.

We DON'T know which is which.

Based on Shakespeare's ”Merchant of Venice”.

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
Exactly one of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: ”The portrait is in this casket.”
Silver casket: ”The portrait is not in this casket.”
Lead casket: ”The portrait is not in the gold casket.”

Where is the portrait?

Suppose portrait is in the gold casket.
    NO - both gold and silver would be true

Suppose portrait is in the silver casket
    COULD WORK - gold/silver both false

Suppose in lead: NO, silver/lead both true

Must be in silver.

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

    can't be May - the 19th is unique, and Bernard WOULD know
    similarly, can't be June (the 18th is unique


Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."

    Can't be July 14 or Aug 14 or Bernard wouldn't be sure


Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."
    can't be Aug 15 or 17 or Albert wouldn't know

    Must be July 16



When is Cheryl's birthday? .

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

∧ - and (can use a caret ^ )
∨ - or (inclusive or) (can use a capital V)
¬ - not (can use ! or ~ instead)
→ - implies (can use ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)

gates still used to design circuits

why do we care about equivalent circuits
    (especially if one uses fewer gates)?

what about programming?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q | p ∧ q
------------
T T |   T
T F |   F
F T |   F
F F |   F


OR:

p q | p ∨ q
------------
T T |  T
T F |  T
F T |  T
F F |  F


NOT:

p | ¬p
-------
T | F
F | T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q | p → q
------------
T T |   T
T F |   F
F T |   T
F F |   T

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

//////////////////////////////////////////

(STOPPED HERE --> will do the rest on Tues Aug 29)

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)

¬(p ∧ (q ∨ r))

p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)

/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?
