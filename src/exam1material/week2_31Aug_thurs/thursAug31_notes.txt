HW 2 due Tuesday, September 5

--> will be creating 2 image files

--> make sure those are added to your git repository!

--> no office hours Monday, September 4


HW 1, problem 7:

You meet two inhabitants: Alex and Bartholomew.

   Alex says: "Bartholomew would say that I am a knave."
   Bartholomew says: "It's not the case that Alex is a knave."






HW 1, problem 5:

Suppose we have the following code fragment:

    if (j > 7 && j <= 13) {
        if (j > 10) {
            a = 4;
        }
    }
    else {
        b = 10;
    }

Just after the code fragment finishes, suppose we know that a is 4
but that b is NOT 10. What can we conclude about j? Explain.

a might have been 4 already - can't conclude anything from that.


if b is not 10, couldn't have gone into else and must have gone into
outer if, so j > 7 && j <= 13

/////////////////////////////////

Today:

- Another parse tree
- A bit more with translations
- Equivalent propositions
- Proving equivalence with truth tables
- DeMorgan's laws
- Negating if-statements
- Satisfiability
- If time, begin proving arguments with truth tables

/////////////////////////////////

How do we draw parse trees again?

Example: draw the parse tree for:

(p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (r → q ∨ p)






/////////////////////////////////

A *proposition* is a statement made up of:
    - propositional atoms (minimal true/false statements that
        don't contain any logical operators)
    - joined together with connectors (∧, ∨, ¬, →)

    resulting statements are either true or false


Example:

You can't enroll for the course if you haven't taken the prerequisite.


--> what are the propositional atoms?

p: You can enroll for the course
q: You have taken the prerequisite


--> translate to propositional logic:

¬q → ¬p



--> more translations:

if you can enroll, you have taken the prereq

p: You can enroll for the course
q: You have taken the prerequisite

p → q






/////////////

Example:

if (x <= 2 || y >= 0) {
    if (z != 17) {
        answer = 25;
    }
}

What are we promising about answer?

if all conditions are met, then I promise that answer is 25

p: x <= 2
q: y >= 0
r: z == 17
s: answer == 25

(p V q) ^ ¬r → s






--> what must be true if answer is NOT 25?

if (x <= 2 || y >= 0) {
    if (z != 17) {
        answer = 25;
    }
}

p: x <= 2
q: y >= 0
r: z == 17
s: answer == 25

if answer isn't 25, something was false along the way

¬s → ((¬p ^ ¬q) V r)





//////////////////////////////////

Consider these two statements:



1) If I am at least 16 years old, then I can drive a car.

2) I'm not at least 16 years old or I can drive a car.


--> how could we translate them to propositional logic statements?

p: I am at least 16 years old
q: I can drive a car

1) p → q
2) ¬p V q


--> are they saying the same thing?




--> could we PROVE it?
(equiv.logika)







//////////////////////////////////

DeMorgan's Laws.

...DeMorgan has so many laws...these are a couple of them.




if (a == 4 || a == 5) {
    statements
}

How could we express the NEGATION
(i.e., what condition would be true for the "else")?


a != 4 && a != 5



///

if (a == 4 && b == 5) {
    statements
}

How could we express the NEGATION
(i.e., what condition would be true for the "else")?

a != 4 || b != 5



//////////////////////////////

DeMorgan's laws in propositional logic:

¬(p ∨ q) is equivalent to... ¬p ∧ ¬q

¬(p ∧ q) is equivalent to... ¬p ∨ ¬q


--> how can we prove DeMorgan's laws?

(demorgan.logika)



////////////////////////

Another if-statement example.

if (Character.isDigit(letter) == true || num < 10) {
    statements
}

--> how would we negate it without using a ! operator?


if (Character.isDigit(letter) == false && num >= 10) {
    statements
}



///////////////////////

And one more. Negate this one:

if ((y >= 4 && num != 14) || x > 0) {
    statements
}

negate it:

if ((y < 4 || num == 14) && x <= 0)) {
    statements
}




///////////////////////

Other equivalences (≡ means "is equivalent to").
(If we wanted, how could we prove them?)


¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q      (DeMorgan's laws)
¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q


p ∧ T ≡ p               (identity laws)
p ∨ F ≡ p


p ∨ p ≡ p               (idempotent laws)
p ∧ p ≡ p

¬(¬p) ≡ p               (double negation law)


p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p               (commutative laws)
p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p

p ->q vs q -> p? NO! -> is not commutative


(p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r)         (associative laws)
(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)


p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)         (distributive laws)
p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)



p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p         (contrapositive)
p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q          (can turn implies into an or)



//////////////////////////

What is equivalent to:

¬p → q   p V q


//////////////////////////

are these equivalent?

    (p → q) → r
    p → (q → r)


just need to find ONE truth assignment that makes one true
and the other false.

want to make the first statement false and second true

p = F
q = F
r = F



In general, how to show statements are NOT equivalent?

/////////////////////////

Satisfiability.

- definition: a statement is satisfiable if there is at least
one truth assignment that makes the statement true


- what kind of statement is satisfiable? what kind is not?

satisfiable: contingent, tautology
not satisfiable: contradictory


- is this satisfiable?

        (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (r ∨ ¬p)

need to make each () clause true

p = F
q = F
r = F

SAT
straightforward approach to checking all possibilities: 2^n combinations

- Aside: P and NP problems

running time programs

can we solve a problem in polynomial time?

can we check a solution to a problem in polynomial time?



////////////////////////

<--------- stopped here, will do rest on Tuesday

////////////////////////

Proving an argument.

*Premises* - pieces of information we are given (assume true)
*Conclusion* - something we are trying to show logically follows
    from our premises.


///

From HW 1:

Suppose we know the following premises:

    - If you have enough Frosted Flakes, then you won't go grocery shopping.

    - You go grocery shopping


What did we say we can conclude?

How can we PROVE it?


--> translations:
    Premises?


    Conclusion?


--> truth table proof:



///

Another example.

Suppose we know:

    I am in the CS department.

    If I am in the CS department or the ECE department,
        then I have a CS account.

    If I have a CS account, then I can log in to the CS lab computers.


I want to prove:

    I can log in to the CS lab computers.



--> How would we translate to propositional logic?





--> How might we demonstrate this with truth tables?








/////////////////////////

Next time:

- counterexamples to arguments
- why proofs with truth tables can be unwieldy
- introduce minimal set of deduction rules
- apply these rules to prove conclusions in propositional logic
